# AirBNB Clone

The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

Only some of the features are implemented to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

Run console.py to open the CLI console. Use "help" to get a list of commands. Use "help [command]" for a specific command.

No external dependencies.

## Testing
Run this command in the base directory to run the unit tests:
```
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```
